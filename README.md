# citation-screening-ml
This work intended to explore the problem of automating citation screening using machine-learning to accelerate the process of generating systematic reviews. It considers citation screening as a binary classification problem whereby a searched study is either "included" for generating a systematic review or is "excluded". 

The input data used for citation screening could be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_-NNapaA2SvAxekAAW55zSZo9jSToVN/view?usp=sharing). It is a tab separated file and the data in it is structured as follows.

| Structured exercise improves physical functioning in women with stages I and II breast cancer: results of a randomized controlled trial.      | 11157015 | Abstract PURPOSE: Self-directed and supervised exercise were compared with usual care in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of structured exercise on physical functioning and other dimensions of health-related quality of life in women with stages I and II breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-three women with stages I and II breast cancer completed baseline evaluations of generic and disease- and site-specific health-related quality of life, aerobic capacity, and body weight. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three intervention groups: usual care (control group), self-directed exercise, or supervised exercise. Quality of life, aerobic capacity, and body weight measures were repeated at 26 weeks... | _"include"_ or _"exclude"_ | Clinical Trial &#124;Comparative Study &#124;Randomized Controlled Trial &#124;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't &#124;Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols &#124;Breast Neoplasms &#124;Breast Neoplasms &#124;Breast Neoplasms &#124;Chemotherapy, Adjuvant &#124;Exercise &#124;Female &#124;Humans &#124;Middle Aged &#124;Neoplasm Staging &#124;Quality of Life &#124;Radiotherapy, Adjuvant |
